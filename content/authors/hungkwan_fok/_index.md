My name is Hungkwan Fok. I am an undergraduate student at Brandeis University double-majoring in physics and applied mathematics. I started to develop my interest in astrophysics after I came to college and got intrigued by the origin of the elements in the milky way when I took a class with Professor Trappitsch in my sophomore year. Now, I will be working on comparing galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model simulations with NuPyCEE with stardust grain measurements. Besides GCE and astrophysics, Iâ€™ve also worked with Professor Jonathan Touboul on mathematical modeling on brain development. Outside of academics, I enjoy cooking, running, and playing badminton.
