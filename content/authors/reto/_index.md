Early on in life I was already fascinated by the stars. First with a small 6" Newton type reflector,
then with an 11" Cassegrain type telescope I observed planets, galaxies, an other objects, which fostered my fascination for
Astronomy. After high school, I went to the <a href="https://www.unibe.ch" target="_blank">University of Bern</a>
in Switzerland and received first my BSc in Physics and Astronomy in 2008 and then my 
MSc in Physics in 2010. I then moved to the University of Chicago, from where I received my PhD
in 2016 for the thesis entitled: “Deciphering Galactic Chemical Evolution: Iron and Nickel Isotopes 
and Cosmic Ray Exposure Ages of Presolar Silicon Carbide Grains”. During my PhD I helped build the
CHILI Resonance Ionization Instrumet at the University of Chicago. 

After my time in Chicago, I moved to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as a postdoc and worked
on the LION Resonance Ionization Instrument. In December 2019 I became a staff scientist at the lab.
In October 2020 I will join the <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/physics/index.html" target="_blank">Physics Department</a>
at <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu" target="_blank">Brandeis University</a> as a research assistant professor.
