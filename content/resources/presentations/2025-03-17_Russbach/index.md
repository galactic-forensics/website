Presolar grains, micrometer-sized particles that condensed in the death throes of dying stars, can today be extracted from meteorites and analyzed individually. These bona-fide stardust grains preserved the isotopic record of the material from which they condensed and can thus be used to directly probe stellar outflows and ejecta in the lab. This has been extensively used in the past, e.g., to study the inner workings of the slow-neutron capture (s-) process by analyzing presolar grains from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. However, some of the istopes in these AGB star grains have not been altered by the s-process and thus rather represent the original composition the parent star started out with. These isotopes are thus ideal proxies to probe the galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of isotopes. In my talk I will present an overview of GCE studies using presolar grains and discuss current views and future opportunities.
