Presolar stardust grains, bona-fide particles that formed in the death throes of dying stars and can today be extracted from meteorites, allow us to probe their parent star's isotopic composition. These grains are the sole messenger for directly probing the isotopic composition of the proton-rich isotopes associated with the p-process(es), since these isotopes generally only make up a minute part of each element. In my talk, I will present the current state of p-process signatures in presolar grains, especially focusing on molybdenum isotopes, and discuss potential implications for the astrophysical site(s) of the p-process. Challenges and future prospects for this research area will also be discussed.
