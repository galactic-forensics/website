This invited talk reviews the discrepancies between in situ and bulk measurements
of the initial <sup>60</sup>Fe abundance in the early Solar System. The 
abundance of this short-lived radionuclide is important to constrain precisely
since it informs the source that contributed the <sup>26</sup>Al that was present
in the solar nebula. The presentation discusses the new re-evaluation of the
in-situ secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements and discusses
the implications of this re-evaluation.


The talk was presented at the 16<sup>th</sup> Symposium on Nuclei in the Cosmos.
