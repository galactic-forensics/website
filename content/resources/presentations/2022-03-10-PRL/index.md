This talk, given at the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, India, presents an introduction to analyzing presolar stardust grains by resonance ionization mass spectrometry. It also introduces the basics of stellar evolution of low-mass stars and its implication on the slow neutron-capture process nuclei. The interplay between stardust analysis and s-process nucleosynthesis models is discussed.
