Scientific experiments often require that 
scientists build their own setup. 
Inexpensive microelectronics, such as [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc),
can furthermore help to automate certain repetitive tasks.

In this workshop,
students with a basic understanding of electrical circuits
learn how to develop a scientific setup using Arduino.
They are introduced to various components step-by-step
until the final project,
an Arduino controlled sample cooling stage,
is fully implemented and working.
The notes for the workshop are intended for students
to go through them by themselves
and do the exercises. 
In my opinion, 
a topic such as this one can only be learned 
by exercises, tinkering, and playing with the components.
Therefore, the workshop notes encourage students to do exactly that.
