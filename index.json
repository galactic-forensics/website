By chance some of these grains were present in the solar nebula and got incorporated in the precursors of meteorites. Some of these meteorite parent bodies have never been altered throughout the history of the solar system. Thus, we can extract stardust grains from such primitive meteorites and analyze them in the laboratory. This allows us to directly probe the nucleosythetic fingerprint of the parent star from which a specific stardust grain formed. Since these grains formed prior to the solar system they are often referred to as presolar grains. The figure below shows a schematic on how we picture the history of these samples.\nThe age of stardust grains During their time in the interstellar medium stardust grains were irradiated with galactic cosmic rays, i.e., high-energy protons and 4He nuclei. These high-energy particles induced spallogenic reactions (click here for more information) in the stardust grain. In a recent study these spallogenically produced nuclides were measured to determinme how long stardust grains traveled from their birthplace to the early solar system, i.e., to determine their cosmic ray exposure age. We found that most grains have condensed up to around 100 million years prior to solar system formation, however, there were also some very old grain among the analyzed ones which formed more than 3 billion years before solar system formation. These samples are thus more than 7 billion years old, which is more than half the age of the Milky Way. Here you can find a more detailed article on this study.\nEncoded stellar information Aside from slight modifications in the interstellar medium, stardust grains carry the nucleosynthetic fingerprint of their parent star. This means that these grains can be used as direct probes to better understand the formation of elements and isotopes in stars as well as the evolution of isotopes over the history of the galaxy. Since different grains originated in different stars, various stellar environments can be probed. For example, so called mainstream grains originated in low-mass stars, which are the main hosts of the slow neutron capture (s-) process. These stars are responsible for producing around half of all elements heavier than iron. Mainstream grains can thus be directly used to probe this s-process and gain valuable insights into the inner working of these nucleosynthesis sites.\nSome isotopes however, e.g., 54Fe and 60Ni are not significantly affected in low-mass stars, meaning that what comes out of the star also went originally in. Such isotopes are thus proxies for the material from which the mainstream grain\u0026rsquo;s parent star formed and allow us to trace galactic chemical evolution. You can find more or on this topic here\nAnalyzing stardust grains The image above shows three different SiC grains that were extracted from the Murchison meteorite. The scalebars show that these grains are on the order of micrometers in size, and in fact, the grains shown here are large compared to many other SiC grains. As the name already says, SiC grains consist mainly of silicon and carbon. Elements of interest in order to study stellar nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution are often only present in trace amounts. Special analytical techniques are thus required to get the most information out of these tiny samples. One of the most senstive techniques is resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS). A description of its inner workings can be found here.\n","date":1590359649,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594184305,"objectID":"ab2035fee783e054037609b7a7b58770","permalink":"https://galactic-forensics.space/project/stardust/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T15:34:09-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/stardust/","section":"project","summary":"Stardust grains formed in the death throes of stars and are found in meteorites.

The big bang only produced hydrogen, helium, and a little bit of lithium. Aside from beryllium and boron, all other elements formed in stars in a process called nucleosynthesis. Depending on their initial masses stars undergo very different developments. A massive star can explode as a supernova at the end of its life while a low-mass star does not have enough energy stored up in order to explode so violently. Different elements and isotopes are associated with the production in different stellar environments. Galactic chemical evolution describes how this evolution of the elements took place since the beginning of the universe and is thus often described as galactic archeology. Below artistic impression (by Jenny Mottar, NASA) beautifully summarizes GCE in one image: from the big bang to complex molecules and the earth everything originates as stardust.\nMetallicity The periodic chart of the elements as chemists use it can be hard to remember, however, it is fairly easy for astronomers. In the astronomical sense, the universe consists of hydrogen, helium, and metals (yes, in the astronomical sense you breathe metals). The amount of metals in a star with respect to hydrogen is called the metallicity. Mass fractions of hydrogen to helium to metals are usually written in astronomy with the letters X, Y, and Z, respectively. The mass fractions of hydrogen, helium, and metals in the sun for example are: Xsun = 0.7381, Ysun = 0.2485, and Zsun = 0.0134. Knowing this number for the sun, any star\u0026rsquo;s metallicity can be expressed in terms of the solar metallicty. Metallicity can however also be expressed as a chemical abundance ratio. Here, the abundance of iron is often measured in a star and used as a proxy for the total metallicity. This abundance ratio is typically written as:\n$$ [\\rm{Fe}/\\rm{H}] = \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{N_{\\rm{Fe}}}{N_{\\rm{H}}} \\right)_{\\rm{star}} - \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{N_{\\rm{Fe}}}{N _{\\rm{H}}} \\right)_{\\rm{sun}}$$\nSince the big bang did not produce metals a first order GCE model can assume that the metallicity of an object is correlated to its age, i.e., an older object started out with a lower metallicty. This is assumption is correct up to a certain degree, however, breaks down when looking at the details of GCE.\nObservables Astronomical observations Traditionally GCE is studied in detail by astronomical observations, specifically spectroscopy. This allows the determination of the elemental composition of stars and, in for certain elements, their isotopic composition. A variety of different stars can be observed, which allows us to study the distribution of elements within the galaxy. Furthermore, different stars have different ages. The elemental starting comopsition of a given star will be observable throughout most of its life, thus astronomical observations also allow us to look at GCE in time.\nStardust grain measurements Stardust grains also allow us to study GCE. While the elemental composition of these grains is primarily dominated by the chemistry of the condensing stellar outflow and is thus not representative of the parent star\u0026rsquo;s composition, stardust grains are excellent tracers for the isotopic comopsition of stars.\nSilicon isotopes in mainstream grains and the puzzling conclusion The figure below shows the silicon isotopic composition of all mainstream SiC stardust grains from low-mass stars taken from the presolar grain database. Plotted are all measurement that have isotope ratio measurements with lower than 10‰ uncertainties.\nThe axes labels are in delta units and describe the deviation of the sample from a standard (here the solar average) in per thousands:\n$$ \\delta ^{i}\\rm{Si}_{28} = \\left[\\frac{\\left(\\frac{^{i}\\rm{Si}}{^{28}\\rm{Si}}\\right) _{\\rm{sample}}}{\\left(\\frac{^{i}\\rm{Si}}{^{28}\\rm{Si}}\\right) _{\\rm{standard}}} - 1\\right] \\times 1000 $$\nThe dashed line at the origin of the plot represents the solar isotopic composotion of silicon.\nFrom GCE calculations we expect that 28Si forms early on and that the isotopes 29Si and 30Si form later on from 28Si. Silicon-28 is thus also called a primary isotope, while 29,30Si are secondary isotopes. We know however that presolar grains are older than the solar system, thus the material from which their stars formed came together before the solar system formed. A low-mass star, such as each parent star of a grain shown in the figure above, does not effectively produce 29Si and only produces a little bit (a few tens of ‰) of 30Si. Silicon isotopes are thus excellent proxies to study GCE.\nWhat is going on then in the figure above? A lot of the grains are clearly enriched in 29Si and 30Si compared to the solar system. In the age-metallicity correlated GCE picture these grains thus seem younger than the solar system. The silicon isotopic composition of presolar grains thus clearly requires that GCE takes place more heterogeneously.\nOther GCE proxies tell the same story In a recent study we tested if the same holds true for the isotopic composition of iron and nickel. The best isotopes to use as GCE proxies here are 54Fe and 60Ni. The figure below shows our results:\nThe dashed, purple line shows the GCE model by Kobayashi et al. (2011) in comparison with our measurements. This linear GCE model ends at solar composition and for older objects shows a decrease in 54Fe and an enhancement in 60Ni. Many of the measured stardust grains look more evolved than the solar system itself, which agrees with the silicion isotopic measurements and also requries GCE to take place heterogeneously.\nMeasurements of stardust grains along with astronomical observations yield important constraints for our understanding of GCE. Astronomical observations are often limited to determine the elemental abundance. Stardust grains on the other hand do not allow us to determine their exact parent star, however, enable an excellent understanding of the isotopic evolution of GCE. The two techniques are thus highly complementary for studying GCE.\n","date":1590359649,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594184305,"objectID":"12474e73c422eb20f83b37c8557d50b6","permalink":"https://galactic-forensics.space/project/gce/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T15:34:09-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/gce/","section":"project","summary":"The Big Bang only formed Hydrogen, Helium, and traces of Lithium.

This means that the average solar composition that the solar nebula started with represents one datapoint in terms of galactic chemical evolution.\nThe solar composition can be measured excellently by observing the sun as well as by analyzing primitive meteorites. Except for volatile species, e.g., hydrogen and the noble gases, the composition of these two sample sets agree very well with each other. However, there are some anomalies that can be found in meteorites, which are very indicative of the exact circumstances under which the solar system formed.\nShort-lived radionuclides Some of the anomalies that can be found in primitive objects from the solar system are enhancement in certain isotopes due to the in situ radioactive decay of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs). Calcium aluminum-rich refractory inclusions (CAIs), which are fluffy looking phases in primitive meteorites, are some of the very first material that condensed in the solar nebula and are the ideal samples to look for such anomalies.\nDetermining the abundance of SLRs in the solar nebula If for example the short-lived 60Fe was incorporated into a solid that condensed early on in the solar system we would be able to measure it today as an enhancement of 60Ni since the original 60Fe, which has a half-life of 2.6 Ma, would have all decayed to its stable daughter by now. The figure below shows how the presence of SLRs can be detected in a given sample.\nThe figure on left shows the scenario at formation. Different minerals condense with different amounts of iron to nickel elemental compositions. The figure in the middle shows what happens with these different phases once they are solidified. The y-axis here always shows the 60Ni/58Ni ratio. The more iron a phase condensed with the more 60Fe it will have incorporated as well. Thus, once all the 60Fe has decayed to 60Ni the phases will end up with different 60Ni/58Ni ratios. The figure on the right shows the scenario today. By measuring different phases for their Fe/Ni elemental ratio (shwown on the x-axis) and their nickel isotopic composition (y-axis), the original value of the 60Fe/56Fe at the time of condensation can be determined by fitting a line to these measurements. In above example this line will have the form:\n$$\\frac{^{60}\\rm{Ni}}{^{58}\\rm{Ni}} = \\left(\\frac{^{60}\\rm{Fe}}{^{56}\\rm{Fe}}\\right)_ 0 \\times \\frac{^{56}\\rm{Fe}}{^{58}\\rm{Ni}} + \\left(\\frac{^{60}\\rm{Ni}}{^{58}\\rm{Ni}}\\right)_ 0$$\nHere, the isotope ratios with subscript 0 represent the initial composition of the isotope ratio when the phase condensed. The original 60Fe/56Fe ratio is thus nothing else than the slope of the regression.\nAssuming that an SLR was distributed homogeneously in the early solar system allows to also date phases relative to each other. For example, if one phase shows half the initial 60Fe/56Fe than another phase we can say that the phase with less initial 60Fe condensed one 60Fe half life (2.6 Ma) after the first one.\nThe presence of 26Al and its effects One of the most prominent SLRs that has been shown to be present in the solar nebula is 26Al (half life 717 ka). Many studies have shown that 26Al was distributed homogeneously in the solar nebula and that its initial abundance when CAIs formed was $$^{26}\\rm{Al}/^{27}\\rm{Al} = 5\\times10^{-5}$$. This has important implications because it allows us to date different phases in the early solar system relative to each other. Furhtermore, when 26Al decays to 26Mg it releases 4 MeV of energy. This is a significant amount and has been shown to be able to heat an asteroid parent body of a given size (and thus of a given 26Al content) significally. In fact, 26Al has been invoked as being a crucial heat source that started the differentiation of early planetesimals.\nThe presence of 26Al in the solar system raises the quesion on where it came from. Since its half-life is only 717 ka it had to be produced just prior to solar system formation. The key to decipher where it came from comes from studying other SLRs that were also present in the solar nebula.\nThe curious case of 60Fe in the solar nebula One nuclide that can help us solve the question on where the 26Al in the early solar system came from is 60Fe. If 60Fe is also present in the solar nebula it was likely produced and injected along with 26Al. A large amount of 60Fe in the early solar nebula, by which we mean a value of $$^{60}\\rm{Fe}/^{56}\\rm{Fe} \u0026gt; 5\\times10^{-7}$$ would make it likely that a supernova that exploded just before the solar system produced and injected the two nucldies. A low value of $$^{60}\\rm{Fe}/^{56}\\rm{Fe} \\sim 10^{-8}$$ would however indicate that no such supernova took place and that the 60Fe does not need to be produced but is rather the galactic background value.\nThis discussion might seem very fabricated, however, for years and years the community has argued over the amount of 60Fe present in the solar nebula and the mentioned values are not just randomly picked. In situ studies of chondrules, objects that formed in the solar system about 2 Ma after CAIs, by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) showed high 60Fe values and thus pointed towards a supernova source. Bulk studies of many meteorites on the other hand consistently measured low 60Fe values. Until recently, the in situ measurements could not be tested with other techniques than SIMS.\nIn a recent publication we re-analyzed one chondrule with resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS). This sample has previously only been studied with SIMS. RIMS has the advantage over SIMS that all nickel isotopes can be measured without interferences. SIMS however can only anlyze 60Ni, 61Ni, and 62Ni. In order to determine the excess in 60Ni the measurements needs to be normalized to another isotope (see isochron figure above). Furthermore, mass dependent fractionation also has to be corrected for, thus measuring a third isotope is required.\nThe above figure shows the new results obtained by RIMS (left, Trappitsch et al., 2018) versus a re-evaluation of the old results by SIMS (right, Telus et al., 2018). To evaluate the SIMS measurements requires doing the described corrections with the low abundance isotope 61Ni. This results in extreme correlations of the uncertainties, which, if not adequately accounted for, can seem like excesses in 60Ni due to in situ decay of 60Fe. With RIMS however this problem does not exist. The figure on the left clearly shows that the errors are uncorrelated thanks to the ability to measure 58Ni.\nOur recent re-evaluation has brought up issues with the data processing that has been done in the determination of the initial 60Fe abundance. It remains to be seen if this is the case for all samples, however, preliminary evaluations of other SIMS measurements show that the same problem occurs in the rest of the dataset. A supernova thus cannot have injected the 26Al and another source, e.g., a Wolf-Rayet star, is required to explain its high value in the solar nebula.\n","date":1590359649,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594184305,"objectID":"0c98ac6ef353818660039d363a012bb9","permalink":"https://galactic-forensics.space/project/slrs/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T15:34:09-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/slrs/","section":"project","summary":"The solar nebula, from which our Solar System formed, represents Milky May material after 9 Ga of galactic chemical evolution.

Determining the trace element isotopic composition thus requries a very sensitive technique. In addition, the ideal technique should be able to determine between different isobars, i.e., be able to analyze isotopes of different elements that have the same mass, e.g., 58Fe and 58Ni, simultaneously.\nResonance ionization mass spectrometry Resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS) is an ideal technique to analyze such particles. The following animation shows schematics on how RIMS works.\n Overview of a RIMS instrument. On the left is the target / sample that should be analyzed. Then ion optics will guide the ions in the time-of-flight mass spectrometer. In this part, ions are initially given the same energy and are then separated by mass over charge by the total flight time they take from the extractor to the detector. The blue box represents the resonance ionization lasers. Material from a sample (target) is removed by either using an ion beam or a desorption laser. After removing sample material a mixture of mostly neutral atoms and secondary ions (usually less than 1%) will be present above the samples. Since the secondary ions are generally noise in RIMS, they are ejected from the sampling area by applying a high voltage to the extraction optics. These secondary ions are given so much energy that they will fly into the back of the reflector and be neturalized there. They thus cannot reach the detector. Above the sample a cloud of neutral atoms is left behind. Resonance lasers ionize all isotopes of the elements of interest selectively creating photoions. By applying the correct voltages to the instrument the created photoions are extracted into the mass spectrometers and analyzed.  Resonance ionization with Ti:Sapphire lasers The advantage of RIMS is the ionization of neutral atoms by tunable, resonant lasers. First of all this process is highly effective since almost all of the atoms that come off in the removal event are neutrals. Further, resonance ionization means that multiple lasers are tuned to stepwise and resonantly excite an atom until it is singly ionized. The figure below for example shows an example for the ionization of titanium.\nThis ionization scheme is taken from Trappitsch et al. (2018). Shown are mutliple transitions for titanium, all of which are highly selective and effective for only this specific element, here titanium. Thus, other elements with potentially overlapping isobars are not ionized.\nMass spectra The figure below shows a mass spectrum recorded by RIMS for the quasi-simultaneous analysis of iron and nickel.\nWhile iron and nickel have an overlapping isobar at mass 58, the ionization of nickel was delayed by several hundred nanoseconds with respect to the ionization of nickel. In the time-of-flight mass analyzer this separation resulted in a separation of these two identical masses allowing the simultaneous detection of 58Fe and 58Ni. RIMS thus, compared to other techniques, allows us to analyze elements with inherent isobaric overlaps simultaneously for all isotopes.\nInstruments Currently only two RIMS instruments are being used for cosmochemistry worldwide, both of which I have worked on. These instruments are the CHILI (Chicago Instrument for Laser Ionization) instrument at the University of Chicago and the Livermore LION (Laser Ionization of Neutrals) instrument at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\nThe image above shows the LION instrument. The mass spectrometer can be seen on the right side, however, the reflectron (in this setup the top of the instrument) is outside the field of view. The center and left part shows the six tunable Ti:Sapphire lasers which allow the simultaneous ionization of various different elements.\n","date":1590359649,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594184305,"objectID":"d4a285013d7a2169483cc3ce21a96e56","permalink":"https://galactic-forensics.space/project/rims/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T15:34:09-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/rims/","section":"project","summary":"Analyzing micrometer-sized stardust grains for their trace-element isotopic compositions requires special instruments, such as resonance ionization mass spectrometers.","tags":[],"title":"Resonance Ionization Mass Spectrometry","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Irradiation of bodies in space Objects in space are constantly irradiated with high-energy particles. Two sources of such particles exist in the solar system: solar cosmic rays (SCRs) originating from the sun and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs).\nAbove figure shows a comparison of the SCR (blue, solid line) and GCR (green, dashed line) spectrum. The SCR can only penetrate the upper few centimeters of any given material in space due to its low energies. On the other hand, GCRs can penetrate down to several meters below the surface of a given meteoroid. Since the outer layers of meteorites are generally lost, only the GCR flux matters when analyzing meteorites.\nNote: Scientists working on cosmogenic nuclides generally distinguish between meteoroids and meteorites. A meteoroid is an rock in space that broke off from its parent asteroid, is thus irradiated by SCR and GCR, and has not hit the Earth yet. A meteorite on the other hand is the rock that fell from the sky, i.e., the meteoroid after it fell down to earth, thus passed the atmosphere and lost most of its outer material by ablation. This ablation usually leads to a meteoroid loosing its SCR record such that only GCR effects can be measured in meteorites.\nSpallation reactions The irradiation of material in space with high-energy particles induced the production of spallogenic nuclides. The figure below shows a schematic on how spallogenic reactions take place on the example of a 28Si nucleus.\nIn panel (1), a high energy proton strikes a target nucleus (here 28Si). This nucleus then breaks up into various lighter nuclei (2). The excited nucleus left behind then decays, e.g., via γ or neutron emission and a cosmogenic nuclide (here 21Ne) is left behind (3). For a given high-energy particle k (a proton for the example above) at a given energy E, the production of a cosmogenic nuclide j from a target element i can be calculated as:\n$$P_{j,i,k} = \\sigma_{j,i,k} J_k$$\nHere, Jk describes the flux of the incident particle of a given energy. In a real scenario many target elements are present in a given meteoroid that can contribute to the production of nuclide j. Furthermore, the GCR and SCR have a variety of different energies, see for example the figure showing the SCR and GCR spectrum above. The total production rate Pj of nuclide j in a meteoroid can then be calculated as:\n$$P_j = \\sum_{i} c_i \\frac{N_A}{A_i} \\sum_k \\int_0^{\\infty} \\sigma_{i,j,k} J_k(E)dE$$\nThe first sum over i considers the meteoroid\u0026rsquo;s composition. Here ci is the concentration of target nuclide i, NA Avogadro\u0026rsquo;s constant, and Ai the mean mass of nuclide i. The production rate also depends on different target elements k, to calculate the total production rate from all all projectiles we thus need to sum over k. The nuclear cross sections are of course projectile k, target nucleus i, product j, and energy E dependent, while the flux of the high-energy particles depends on their energy E. Integrating over all energies is thus required as well.\nCosmic ray exposure ages The irradiation of a meteorite space induces spallation reactions and leads to the production of so called cosmogenic nuclides. Cosmogenic nuclide production is generally a very minor contribution and thus can only be detected in low-abundance isotopes, e.g., noble gases. If for example the 21Ne composition in a given meteorite can be measured (m) and the production rate Pj can be calculated, the time the object was irradiated in space can be determined as:\n$$t = \\frac{m}{P_j}$$\nThe time t is generally referred to as the cosmic ray exposure age of the sample.

Isotopes of U, Pu, and Am were simultaneously quantified using a new method that removes and/or resolves the isobaric interferences at 238U/238Pu and 241Pu/241Am without sample preparation other than cutting and mounting small (∼10 μm) samples. Trends in burnup and neutron capture product distributions were correlated with the sampling positions inside the reactor. The results show the skin effect, in which the core and near-edge regions of a fuel pellet exhibit strong differences in actinide concentrations and isotope distributions due to differences in the neutron energy spectra between the pellet rim and the core. While no elemental concentration measurements were made, the ability to measure the 238Pu/239Pu ratio in the presence of a 7400× excess of 238U enabled an estimate of the enhancement in Pu concentration due to the skin effect at the rim of the pellet.","tags":null,"title":"Simultaneous Isotopic Analysis of U, Pu, and Am in Spent Nuclear Fuel by Resonance Ionization Mass Spectrometry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Reto Trappitsch"],"categories":null,"content":"The Big Bang only formed hydrogen and helium.

Several fragments fell onto frozen surfaces of lakes and, thanks to weather radar data, were recovered days after the fall. The studied rock fragments show no or little signs of terrestrial weathering. Here, we present the initial results from an international consortium study to describe the fall, characterize the meteorite, and probe the collision history of Hamburg. About 1 kg of recovered meteorites was initially reported. Petrology, mineral chemistry, trace element and organic chemistry, and O and Cr isotopic compositions are characteristic of H4 chondrites. Cosmic ray exposure ages based on cosmogenic 3He, 21Ne, and 38Ar are ~12 Ma, and roughly agree with each other. Noble gas data as well as the cosmogenic 10Be concentration point to a small 40–60 cm diameter meteoroid. An 40Ar‐39Ar age of 4532 ± 24 Ma indicates no major impact event occurring later in its evolutionary history, consistent with data of other H4 chondrites. Microanalyses of phosphates with LA‐ICPMS give an average Pb‐Pb age of 4549 ± 36 Ma. This is in good agreement with the average SIMS Pb‐Pb phosphate age of 4535.3 ± 9.5 Ma and U‐Pb Concordia age of 4535 ± 10 Ma. The weighted average age of 4541.6 ± 9.5 Ma reflects the metamorphic phosphate crystallization age after parent body formation in the early solar system.","tags":null,"title":"The Fall, Recovery, Classification and Initial Characterization of the Hamburg, Michigan H4 Chondrite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

As the effects of cosmic rays on the D production in lunar samples remain poorly understood, we determine here the D content and noble gas (He-Ne-Ar) characteristics of nominally anhydrous mineral (olivine and pyroxene) grains and rock fragments, respectively, from different documented depths (0 to ≥4.8 cm) within Apollo olivine basalt 12018. Deuterium concentrations, determined by secondary ion mass spectrometry, and cosmogenic 3He, 21Ne, and 38Ar abundances, measured by CO2 laser extraction static mass spectrometry, are constant over the depth range investigated. Neon isotope ratios (20Ne/22Ne ≈0.86 and 21Ne/22Ne ≈0.85) of the cosmogenic endmember are comparable to the theoretical signature of GCR-produced neon. These observations indicate that the presence of significant amounts of SCR nuclides in the studied sub-samples can be ruled out. Hence, D within the olivines and pyroxenes must have been predominantly produced in situ by GCR-induced spallation reactions during exposure at the lunar surface. Comparison of the amount of D with the 21Ne (184 ± 26 Ma) or 38Ar (193 ± 25 Ma) exposure ages yields a D production rate that is in good agreement with the value of mol(g rock)−1Ma−1 from Füri et al. (2017). These results confirm that cosmic ray effects can substantially alter the hydrogen isotope (D/H) ratio of indigenous ‘water’ in returned extraterrestrial samples and meteorites with long exposure ages.","tags":["deuterium","water","noble gases","cosmic rays","olivine","Moon"],"title":"Cosmic ray effects on the isotope composition of hydrogen and noble gases in lunar samples: Insights from Apollo 12018","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

We present evidence that the majority of large (μm-sized) meteoritic silicon carbide (SiC) grains formed in C-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that were more metal-rich than the Sun. In the framework of the slow neutron captures (the s process) that occur in AGB stars, the lower-than-solar 88Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios measured in the large SiC grains can only be accompanied by Ce/Y elemental ratios that are also lower than solar and predominately observed in metal-rich barium stars—the binary companions of AGB stars. Such an origin suggests that these large grains represent the material from high-metallicity AGB stars needed to explain the s-process nucleosynthesis variations observed in bulk meteorites. In the outflows of metal-rich, C-rich AGB stars, SiC grains are predicted to be small (≅0.2 μm); large (≅μm-sized) SiC grains can grow if the number of dust seeds is 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than the standard value of 10−13 times the number of H atoms. We therefore predict that with increasing metallicity, the number of dust seeds might decrease, resulting in the production of larger SiC grains.","tags":null,"title":"Origin of large meteoritic SiC stardust grains in metal-rich AGB stars","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is a collection of links that we use regularly or want to keep in mind.

In this work we consider the evolution and nucleosynthesis of low-mass AGB stars. We provide an update of the NuGrid Set models, adopting the same general physics assumptions but using an updated convective-boundary-mixing model accounting for the contribution from internal gravity waves. The combined data set includes the initial masses MZAMS/M⊙ = 2, 3 for Z = 0.03, 0.02, 0.01. These new models are computed with the mesa stellar code and the evolution is followed up to the end of the AGB phase. The nucleosynthesis was calculated for all isotopes in post-processing with the NuGrid mppnp code. The convective-boundary-mixing model leads to the formation of a 13C-pocket three times wider compared to the one obtained in the previous set of models, bringing the simulation results now in closer agreement with observations. Using these new models, we discuss the potential impact of other processes inducing mixing, like rotation, adopting parametric models compatible with theory and observations.

We show that the Mo isotope data can be used to constrain the maximum stellar temperatures (*T*MAX) during thermal pulses in AGB stars. Comparison of FRUITY Torino AGB nucleosynthesis model calculations with the grain data for Mo isotopes points to an origin from low-mass (~1.5–3 *M*⊙) rather than intermediate-mass (3–~9 *M*⊙) AGB stars. Because of the low efficiency of 22Ne(α, n)25Mg at the low *T*MAX values attained in low-mass AGB stars, model calculations cannot explain the large 30Si excesses of Z grains as arising from neutron capture, so these excesses remain a puzzle at the moment.","tags":null,"title":"Presolar Silicon Carbide Grains of Types Y and Z: Their Molybdenum Isotopic Compositions and Stellar Origins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Stephan","Reto Trappitsch","Peter Hoppe","Andrew M.

All observed isotope ratios can be explained by mixtures of pure s-process matter with isotopically solar material. Grain residues were subsequently analyzed for carbon, nitrogen, silicon, and sulfur isotopes, as well as a subset for 26Al–26Mg systematics using the NanoSIMS. These analyses showed that all but one grain are mainstream grains, most probably coming from low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. One grain is of the AB type, for which the origin is still a matter of debate. The high precision of molybdenum isotope measurements with CHILI provides the best estimate to date for s-process molybdenum made in low-mass AGB stars. The average molybdenum isotopic abundances produced by the s-process found in the analyzed mainstream SiC grains are 0% 92Mo, 0.73% 94Mo, 13.30% 95Mo, 36.34% 96Mo, 9.78% 97Mo, 39.42% 98Mo, and 0.43% 100Mo. Solar molybdenum can be explained as a combination of 45.9% s-process, 30.6% r-process, and 23.5% p-process contributions. Furthermore, the observed variability in the individual grain data provides insights into the variability of conditions (neutron density, temperature, and timescale) during s-process nucleosynthesis in the grains' parent stars, as they have subtle effects on specific molybdenum isotope ratios. Finally, the results suggest that the ratio between p- and r-process molybdenum in presolar SiC from many different types of parent stars is Mop/Mor = 0.767, the value inferred for the solar system and consistent with what has been found in bulk samples and leachates of primitive meteorites.","tags":["circumstellar matter","dust","extinction","meteorites","meteors","meteoroids","nuclear reactions","nucleosynthesis","abundances","stars: AGB and post-AGB"],"title":"Molybdenum Isotopes in Presolar Silicon Carbide Grains: Details of s-process Nucleosynthesis in Parent Stars and Implications for r- and p-processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Fryer","Eric Burns","Pete Roming","Sean Couch","Marek Szczepańczyk","Pat Slane","Irene Tamborra","Reto Trappitsch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592794783,"objectID":"4fa1e3e334eb4dad50edbebaaeefc077","permalink":"https://galactic-forensics.space/publication/fryer-19/","publishdate":"2020-06-17T01:53:02.833921Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fryer-19/","section":"publication","summary":"Multi-messenger diagnostics for core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) have been used for over half a century when astronomers began using dust grains to probe the yields from supernovae.

Although rare in the Milky Way where supernovae can be probed by multiple messengers, the science enabled in each event is enormous. Most of the gravitational energy released during collapse is emitted in MeV neutrinos that should be detectable within a few Mpc with next generation (NG) neutrino experiments.

We find that the 60Fe yield is a monotonic increasing function of the uncertain 59Fe(n, γ)60Fe cross-section and that a factor of 10 reduction in the reaction rate results in a factor of 8–10 reduction in the 60Fe yield, while a factor of 10 increase in the rate increases the yield by a factor of 4–7. We find that none of the 189 simulations we have performed are consistent with a core-collapse supernova triggering the formation of the Solar system, and that only models using 59Fe(n, γ)60Fe cross-section that is less than or equal to that from NON-SMOKER can reproduce the observed 60Fe/26Al line flux ratio in the diffuse interstellar medium. We examine the prospects of detecting old core-collapse supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Milky Way from their gamma-ray emission from the decay of 60Fe, finding that the next generation of gamma-ray missions could be able to discover up to ∼100 such old SNRs as well as measure the 60Fe yields of a handful of known Galactic SNRs. We also predict the X-ray spectrum that is produced by atomic transitions in 60Co following its ionization by internal conversion and give theoretical X-ray line fluxes as a function of remnant age as well as the Doppler and fine-structure line broadening effects. The X-ray emission presents an interesting prospect for addressing the missing SNR problem with future X-ray missions.","tags":null,"title":"$^{60}$Fe in core-collapse supernovae and prospects for X-ray and gamma-ray detection in supernova remnants","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592019194,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://galactic-forensics.space/contact/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592019194,"objectID":"3407d9030c19df7996ca3124623e8db7","permalink":"https://galactic-forensics.space/menu-group-members/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/menu-group-members/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Group Members","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Michael R.

U-Pu/Xe ages are comparable to previously reported Sm-Nd and U-Pb ages obtained from NWA 7034 and confirm an ancient (4.3 billion years) age for the source lithology. After almost 3000 million years (Ma) of quiescence, the source terrain experienced several hundred million years of thermal metamorphism recorded by the K-Ar system that appears to have varied both spatially and temporally. Such protracted metamorphism is consistent with plume-related magmatism and suggests that the source terrain covered an areal extent comparable to plume-fed edifices (hundreds of square kilometers). The retention of such expansive, ancient volcanic terrains in the southern highlands over billions of years suggests that formation of the martian crustal dichotomy, a topographic and geophysical divide between the heavily cratered southern highlands and smoother plains of the northern lowlands, likely predates emplacement of the NWA 7034 source terrain—that is, it formed within the first ~100 Ma of planetary formation.","tags":null,"title":"Chronology of Martian breccia NWA 7034 and implications for formation of the Martian crustal dichotomy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

While bulk measurements of early solar system phases show a low abundance consistent with galactic background, some in situ measurements by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) imply a higher abundance, which would require injection from a nearby supernova (SN). Here we present in situ nickel isotopic analyses by resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS) in a chondrule from the primitive meteorite Semarkona (LL3.00). The same chondrule had been previously analyzed by SIMS. Despite improved precision compared to SIMS, the RIMS nickel isotopic data do not reveal any resolved excesses of 60Ni that could be unambiguously ascribed to in situ 60Fe decay. Linear regression of 60Ni/58Ni versus 56Fe/58Ni yields an initial 60Fe/56Fe ratio for this chondrule of (3.8 ± 6.9) × 10-8, which is consistent with both the low initial value found by bulk measurements and the low end of the range of initial ratios inferred from some in situ work. The same regression also gives a solar initial 60Ni/58Ni ratio, which shows that this sample was not disturbed by nickel mobilization, thus agreeing with a low initial 60Fe/56Fe ratio. These findings agree with a re-evaluation of previous SIMS measurements of the same sample. Supernova injection of 60Fe into the solar system or its parental cloud material is therefore not necessary to account for the measured solar system's initial amount of 60Fe.","tags":null,"title":"New Constraints for the Abundance of $^{60}$Fe in the Early Solar System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.

We have studied the carbon, silicon, iron, and nickel isotopic compositions of presolar silicon carbide (SiC) grains from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars to better understand GCE. Since only the neutron-rich nuclides in these grains have been heavily influenced by the parent star, the neutron-poor nuclides serve as GCE proxies. Using CHILI, a new resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS) instrument, we measured 74 presolar SiC grains for all iron and nickel isotopes. With the CHARISMA instrument, 13 presolar SiC grains were analyzed for iron isotopes. All grains were also measured by NanoSIMS for their carbon and silicon isotopic compositions. A comparison of the measured neutron-rich isotopes with models for AGB star nucleosynthesis shows that our measurements are consistent with AGB star predictions for low-mass stars between half-solar and solar metallicity. Furthermore, our measurements give an indication on the 22Ne(α, n)25Mg reaction rate. In terms of GCE, we find that the GCE-dominated iron and nickel isotope ratios, 54Fe/56Fe and 60Ni/58Ni, correlate with their GCE- dominated counterpart in silicon, 29Si/28Si. The measured GCE trends include the Solar System composition, showing that the Solar System is not a special case. However, as seen in silicon and titanium, many presolar SiC grains are more evolved for iron and nickel than the Solar System. This confirms prior findings and agrees with observations of large stellar samples that a simple age-metallicity relationship for GCE cannot explain the composition of the solar neighborhood.","tags":["Presolar grains","S-process","Stellar nucleosynthesis","Galactic chemical evolution","Isotope anomalies"],"title":"Simultaneous iron and nickel isotopic analyses of presolar silicon carbide grains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

We find all models show an excess of 96Zr relative to the measurements, but the model abundances are affected by the fractionation between Sr and Zr since a large contribution to 90Zr is due to the radiogenic decay of 90Sr. Some supernova models show excesses of 95,97Mo and depletion of 96Mo relative to solar.

We present models and s-process simulations that adopt a treatment of convective boundaries based on the results of hydrodynamic simulations and on the theory of mixing due to gravity waves in the vicinity of convective boundaries. Hydrodynamics simulations suggest the presence of convective boundary mixing (CBM) at the bottom of the thermal pulse-driven convective zone. Similarly, convection-induced mixing processes are proposed for the mixing below the convective envelope during third dredge-up (TDU), where the 13C pocket for the s process in AGB stars forms.

As reported previously, the He-intershell abundances of 12C and 16O are increased by CBM at the bottom of the pulse-driven convection zone. This mixing is affecting the 22Ne(α, n)25Mg activation and the s-process efficiency in the 13C-pocket. In our model, CBM at the bottom of the convective envelope during the TDU represents gravity wave mixing.

Some of these grains survived the voyage through the interstellar medium (ISM) and were incorporated into meteorite parent bodies at the formation of the Solar System. An important question is when these stellar processes happened, i.e., how long presolar grains were drifting through the ISM. While conventional radiometric dating of such small grains is very difficult, presolar grains are irradiated with galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) in the ISM, which induce the production of cosmogenic nuclides. This opens the possibility to determine cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages, i.e., how long presolar grains were irradiated in the ISM. Here, we present a new model for the production and loss of cosmogenic 3He, 6,7Li, and 21,22Ne in presolar SiC grains. The cosmogenic production rates are calculated using a state-of-the-art nuclear cross-section database and a GCR spectrum in the ISM consistent with recent Voyager data. Our findings are that previously measured 3He and 21Ne CRE ages agree within the (sometimes large) 2σ uncertainties and that the CRE ages for most presolar grains are smaller than the predicted survival times. The obtained results are relatively robust since interferences from implanted low-energy GCRs into the presolar SiC grains and/or from cosmogenic production within the meteoroid can be neglected.","tags":null,"title":"Production and recoil loss of cosmogenic nuclides in presolar grains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

In our own Solar System, the presence of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) in the oldest materials has been attributed to spallation reactions induced in phases that were irradiated by energetic particles in the solar nebula. Furthermore, observations of other protoplanetary disks show a mixture of crystalline and amorphous grains, though no correlation between grain crystallinity and disk or stellar properties have been identified. As most models for the origin of crystalline grains would predict such correlations, it was suggested that amorphization by stellar cosmic-rays may be masking or erasing such correlations. Here we quantitatively investigate these possibilities by modeling the interaction of energetic particles emitted by a young star with the surrounding protoplanetary disk. We do this by tracing the energy evolution of SCRs emitted from the young star through the disk and model the amount of time that dust grains would spend in regions where they would be exposed to these particles. We find that this irradiation scenario cannot explain the total SLR content of the solar nebula; however, this scenario could play a role in the amorphization of crystalline material at different locations or epochs of the disk over the course of its evolution.","tags":null,"title":"Solar cosmic-ray interaction with protoplanetary disks: Production of short-lived radionuclides and amorphization of crystalline material","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

These are observationally known to be enriched in heavy elements, such as C, O and Ne, that must originate in layers below the H-flash convection zone. Building on our previous work, we now present stellar evolution simulations of ONe novae and provide a comprehensive comparison of our models with published ones. Some of our models include exponential convective boundary mixing to account for the observed enrichment of the nova ejecta even when accreted material has a solar abundance distribution. Our models produce maximum temperature evolution profiles and nucleosynthesis yields in good agreement with models that generate enriched ejecta by assuming that the accreted material was pre-mixed. We confirm for ONe novae the result we reported previously, i.e. we found that 3He could be produced in situ in solar-composition envelopes accreted with slow rates (*Ṁ*-10 *M*⊙ yr-1⁠) by cold (*T*WD 7 K) CO WDs, and that convection was triggered by 3He burning before the nova outburst in that case. In addition, we now find that the interplay between the 3He production and destruction in the solar-composition envelope accreted with an intermediate rate, e.g. *Ṁ*=10-10*M*⊙ yr-1⁠, by the 1.15 *M*⊙ ONe WD with a relatively high initial central temperature, e.g. *T*WD = 15 × 106 K, leads to the formation of a thick radiative buffer zone that separates the bottom of the convective envelope from the WD surface. We present detailed nucleosynthesis calculations based on the post-processing technique, and demonstrate in which way much simpler single-zone *T* and ρ trajectories extracted from the multi-zone stellar evolution simulations can be used, in lieu of full multi-zone simulations, to analyse the sensitivity of nova abundance predictions on nuclear reaction rate uncertainties.

These SEC grains arrived on Earth as micrometeorites in the aftermath of the L chondrite parent body (LCPB) breakup event, 470 Ma ago. A significant fraction of them show prolonged exposure to galactic cosmic rays for up to several 10 Ma. The majority of the cosmogenic noble gases in these grains were probably acquired in the regolith of the LCPB (Meier et al. ). Ghubara, an L chondritic regolith breccia with an Ar-Ar shock age of 470 Ma, is a sample of that regolith. We find cosmic-ray exposure ages of up to several 10 Ma in some Ghubara chromite grains, confirming for the first time that individual chromite grains with such high exposure ages indeed existed in the LCPB regolith, and that the 10 Ma cosmic-ray exposure ages found in recent micrometeorites are thus not necessarily indicative of an origin in the Kuiper Belt. Some Ghubara chromite grains show much lower concentrations of cosmogenic He and Ne, indicating that the 4π (last-stage) exposure age of the Ghubara meteoroid lasted only 4-6 Ma. This exposure age is considerably shorter than the 15-20 Ma suggested before from bulk analyses, indicating that bulk samples have seen regolith pre-exposure as well. The shorter last-stage exposure age probably links Ghubara to a small peak of 40Ar-poor L5 chondrites of the same exposure age. Furthermore, and quite unexpectedly, we find a Ne component similar to presolar Ne-HL in the chromite grains, perhaps indicating that some presolar Ne can be preserved even in meteorites of petrologic type 5.","tags":null,"title":"He and Ne in individual chromite grains from the regolith breccia Ghubara (L5): Exploring the history of the L chondrite parent body regolith","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

No mixing from deeper Si-rich material and/or fractionation of Si from S due to molecular chemistry is needed to explain the 32S enrichments. The abundance of 32Si in the grains can provide constraints on the neutron density reached during the SN explosion in the C-rich He shell material. The impact of the large uncertainty of the neutron capture cross sections in the 32Si region is discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Silicon carbide grains of type C provide evidence for the production of the unstable isotope $^{32}$Si in supernovae","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

Our model is based on various nuclear model codes to calculate recoil cross sections, recoil ranges, and finally the percentages of the cosmogenic nuclides that are lost as a function of grain size, chemical composition of the grain, and the spectral distribution of the projectiles. The main advantage of our new model compared with earlier approaches is that we consider the entire SCR particle spectrum up to 240 MeV and not only single energy points. Recoil losses for GCR-produced nuclides are assumed to be equal to recoil losses for SCR-produced nuclides. Combining the model predictions with Poynting-Robertson orbital lifetimes, we calculate cosmic-ray exposure ages for recently studied MMs, cosmic spherules, and IDPs. The ages for MMs and the cosmic-spherule are in the range ","tags":null,"title":"Cosmogenic production rates and recoil loss effects in micrometeorites and interplanetary dust particles","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Fe, Ni presolar grain measurements Data from Trappitsch et al.
