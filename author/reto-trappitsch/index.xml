scientists build their own setup.
Inexpensive microelectronics, such as
&lt;a href="https://www.arduino.cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arduino&lt;/a>,
can furthermore help to automate certain repetitive tasks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this workshop,
students with a basic understanding of electrical circuits
learn how to develop a scientific setup using Arduino.
They are introduced to various components step-by-step
until the final project,
an Arduino controlled sample cooling stage,
is fully implemented and working.
The notes for the workshop are intended for students
to go through them by themselves
and do the exercises.
In my opinion,
a topic such as this one can only be learned
by exercises, tinkering, and playing with the components.
Therefore, the workshop notes encourage students to do exactly that.&lt;/p>

of the initial &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe abundance in the early Solar System. The
abundance of this short-lived radionuclide is important to constrain precisely
since it informs the source that contributed the &lt;sup>26&lt;/sup>Al that was present
in the solar nebula. The presentation discusses the new re-evaluation of the
in-situ secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements and discusses
the implications of this re-evaluation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The talk was presented at the 16&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> Symposium on Nuclei in the Cosmos.

All other elements,
e.g., the ones we are made of,
were subsequently formed in stars. This course discusses how these elements
formed and how we can directly measure and probe nucleosynthesis and galactic
chemical evolution.
The course starts with the solar composition, i.e.,
the composition of the Solar System that we are ultimately trying to explain.
It then goes back to the Big Bang to start with the first nucleosynthesis events.
From here on, the course loops through various stellar nucleosynthesis events
and discusses observations and measurements along the way that help us
to understand how the elements we are all made of formed in the first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This course was first held at Brandeis University in Spring 2021
and is geared as an elective course towards advanced undergraduates and
early graduate students. The course is design as a mixture between
lectures and reading / discussion of original scientific manuscripts.&lt;/p>

and how it can be used to better understand astrophysical processes such as
the slow neutron capture process and the formation of proton- and neutron-rich
nuclides. Finally, the presentation discusses future opportunities with stardust
and how these measurements could help to further our knowledge of
galactic chemical evolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The talk was presented at the virtual 2020 JINA Horizons Meeting.
