&lt;p>Stardust grains condensed in the outflows of dying stars and subsequently drifted through the interstellar medium. By chance some of these grains were present in the solar nebula and got incorporated in the precursors of meteorites. Some of these meteorite parent bodies have never been altered throughout the history of the solar system. Thus, we can extract stardust grains from such primitive meteorites and analyze them in the laboratory. This allows us to directly probe the nucleosythetic fingerprint of the parent star from which a specific stardust grain formed. Since these grains formed prior to the solar system they are often referred to as presolar grains. The figure below shows a schematic on how we picture the history of these samples.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="the-age-of-stardust-grains">The age of stardust grains&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>During their time in the interstellar medium stardust grains were irradiated with galactic cosmic rays, i.e., high-energy protons and &lt;sup>4&lt;/sup>He nuclei. These high-energy particles induced spallogenic reactions (click
&lt;a href="https://galactic-forensics.space/project/cosnucs/">here&lt;/a> for more information) in the stardust grain. In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1904573117" target="_blank">recent study&lt;/a> these spallogenically produced nuclides were measured to determinme how long stardust grains traveled from their birthplace to the early solar system, i.e., to determine their cosmic ray exposure age. We found that most grains have condensed up to around 100 million years prior to solar system formation, however, there were also some very old grain among the analyzed ones which formed more than 3 billion years before solar system formation. These samples are thus more than 7 billion years old, which is more than half the age of the Milky Way. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1904573117" target="_blank">Here&lt;/a> you can find a more detailed article on this study.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="encoded-stellar-information">Encoded stellar information&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Aside from slight modifications in the interstellar medium, stardust grains carry the nucleosynthetic fingerprint of their parent star. This means that these grains can be used as direct probes to better understand the formation of elements and isotopes in stars as well as the evolution of isotopes over the history of the galaxy. Since different grains originated in different stars, various stellar environments can be probed. For example, so called mainstream grains originated in low-mass stars, which are the main hosts of the slow neutron capture (&lt;em>s&lt;/em>-) process. These stars are responsible for producing around half of all elements heavier than iron. Mainstream grains can thus be directly used to probe this &lt;em>s&lt;/em>-process and gain valuable insights into the inner working of these nucleosynthesis sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some isotopes however, e.g., &lt;sup>54&lt;/sup>Fe and &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Ni are not significantly affected in low-mass stars, meaning that what comes out of the star also went originally in. Such isotopes are thus proxies for the material from which the mainstream grain&amp;rsquo;s parent star formed and allow us to trace galactic chemical evolution. You can find more or on this topic

&lt;p>The image above shows three different SiC grains that were extracted from the Murchison meteorite. The scalebars show that these grains are on the order of micrometers in size, and in fact, the grains shown here are large compared to many other SiC grains. As the name already says, SiC grains consist mainly of silicon and carbon. Elements of interest in order to study stellar nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution are often only present in trace amounts. Special analytical techniques are thus required to get the most information out of these tiny samples. One of the most senstive techniques is resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS). A description of its inner workings can be found

&lt;p>Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) is the field that studies how elements evolved in the universe. The big bang only produced hydrogen, helium, and a little bit of lithium. Aside from beryllium and boron, all other elements formed in stars in a process called nucleosynthesis. Depending on their initial masses stars undergo very different developments. A massive star can explode as a supernova at the end of its life while a low-mass star does not have enough energy stored up in order to explode so violently. Different elements and isotopes are associated with the production in different stellar environments. Galactic chemical evolution describes how this evolution of the elements took place since the beginning of the universe and is thus often described as galactic archeology. Below artistic impression (by Jenny Mottar, NASA) beautifully summarizes GCE in one image: from the big bang to complex molecules and the earth everything originates as stardust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://galactic-forensics.space/img/projects/gce/gce_mottar.jpg" alt="GCE by Jenny Mottar">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="metallicity">Metallicity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The periodic chart of the elements as chemists use it can be hard to
remember, however, it is fairly easy for astronomers. In the
astronomical sense, the universe consists of hydrogen, helium, and metals (yes,
in the astronomical sense you breathe metals). The amount of metals in a star
with respect to hydrogen is called the metallicity. Mass fractions of hydrogen
to helium to metals are usually written in astronomy with the letters &lt;em>X&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Y&lt;/em>,
and &lt;em>Z&lt;/em>, respectively. The mass fractions of hydrogen, helium, and metals in the
sun for example are: &lt;em>X&lt;/em>&lt;sub>sun&lt;/sub> = 0.7381, &lt;em>Y&lt;/em>&lt;sub>sun&lt;/sub> = 0.2485, and
&lt;em>Z&lt;/em>&lt;sub>sun&lt;/sub> = 0.0134. Knowing this number for the sun, any star&amp;rsquo;s
metallicity can be expressed in terms of the solar metallicty. Metallicity can
however also be expressed as a chemical abundance ratio. Here, the abundance of
iron is often measured in a star and used as a proxy for the total metallicity.
This abundance ratio is typically written as:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ [\rm{Fe}/\rm{H}] = \log_{10} \left( \frac{N_{\rm{Fe}}}{N_{\rm{H}}} \right)_{\rm{star}} - \log_{10} \left( \frac{N_{\rm{Fe}}}{N _{\rm{H}}} \right)_{\rm{sun}}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the big bang did not produce metals a first order GCE model can assume that the metallicity of an object is correlated to its age, i.e., an older object started out with a lower metallicty. This is assumption is correct up to a certain degree, however, breaks down when looking at the details of GCE.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="observables">Observables&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="astronomical-observations">Astronomical observations&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Traditionally GCE is studied in detail by astronomical observations, specifically spectroscopy. This allows the determination of the elemental composition of stars and, in for certain elements, their isotopic composition. A variety of different stars can be observed, which allows us to study the distribution of elements within the galaxy. Furthermore, different stars have different ages. The elemental starting comopsition of a given star will be observable throughout most of its life, thus astronomical observations also allow us to look at GCE in time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="stardust-grain-measurements">Stardust grain measurements&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Stardust grains also allow us to study GCE. While the elemental composition of these grains is primarily dominated by the chemistry of the condensing stellar outflow and is thus not representative of the parent star&amp;rsquo;s composition, stardust grains are excellent tracers for the isotopic comopsition of stars.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="silicon-isotopes-in-mainstream-grains-and-the-puzzling-conclusion">Silicon isotopes in mainstream grains and the puzzling conclusion&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The figure below shows the silicon isotopic composition of all mainstream SiC stardust grains from low-mass stars taken from the &lt;a href="https://presolar.physics.wustl.edu/presolar-grain-database/" target="_blank">presolar grain database&lt;/a>. Plotted are all measurement that have isotope ratio measurements with lower than 10‰ uncertainties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://galactic-forensics.space/img/projects/gce/sic_si_isos.png" alt="SiC Stardust Silicon Isotopes">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The axes labels are in delta units and describe the deviation of the sample from a standard (here the solar average) in per thousands:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ \delta ^{i}\rm{Si}_{28} = \left[\frac{\left(\frac{^{i}\rm{Si}}{^{28}\rm{Si}}\right) _{\rm{sample}}}{\left(\frac{^{i}\rm{Si}}{^{28}\rm{Si}}\right) _{\rm{standard}}} - 1\right] \times 1000 $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dashed line at the origin of the plot represents the solar isotopic composotion of silicon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From GCE calculations we expect that &lt;sup>28&lt;/sup>Si forms early on and that the isotopes &lt;sup>29&lt;/sup>Si and &lt;sup>30&lt;/sup>Si form later on from &lt;sup>28&lt;/sup>Si. Silicon-28 is thus also called a primary isotope, while &lt;sup>29,30&lt;/sup>Si are secondary isotopes. We know however that presolar grains are older than the solar system, thus the material from which their stars formed came together before the solar system formed. A low-mass star, such as each parent star of a grain shown in the figure above, does not effectively produce &lt;sup>29&lt;/sup>Si and only produces a little bit (a few tens of ‰) of &lt;sup>30&lt;/sup>Si. Silicon isotopes are thus excellent proxies to study GCE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is going on then in the figure above? A lot of the grains are clearly enriched in &lt;sup>29&lt;/sup>Si and &lt;sup>30&lt;/sup>Si compared to the solar system. In the age-metallicity correlated GCE picture these grains thus seem younger than the solar system. The silicon isotopic composition of presolar grains thus clearly requires that GCE takes place more heterogeneously.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="other-gce-proxies-tell-the-same-story">Other GCE proxies tell the same story&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2017.05.031" target="_blank">recent study&lt;/a> we tested if the same holds true for the isotopic composition of iron and nickel. The best isotopes to use as GCE proxies here are &lt;sup>54&lt;/sup>Fe and &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Ni. The figure below shows our results:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://galactic-forensics.space/img/projects/gce/gce_fe_ni_trappitsch18_380px.png" alt="Iron and Nickel Results in Presolar SiC Grains">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dashed, purple line shows the GCE model by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18621.x" target="_blank">Kobayashi et al. (2011)&lt;/a> in comparison with our measurements. This linear GCE model ends at solar composition and for older objects shows a decrease in &lt;sup>54&lt;/sup>Fe and an enhancement in &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Ni. Many of the measured stardust grains look more evolved than the solar system itself, which agrees with the silicion isotopic measurements and also requries GCE to take place heterogeneously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Measurements of stardust grains along with astronomical observations yield important constraints for our understanding of GCE. Astronomical observations are often limited to determine the elemental abundance. Stardust grains on the other hand do not allow us to determine their exact parent star, however, enable an excellent understanding of the isotopic evolution of GCE. The two techniques are thus highly complementary for studying GCE.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Solar Nebula</title><link>https://galactic-forensics.space/project/slrs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 15:34:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://galactic-forensics.space/project/slrs/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-composition-of-the-solar-nebula">The composition of the solar nebula&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The solar system formed around 4.5 billion years ago, which is around 9 billion years after the formation of the Milky Way itself. This means that the average solar composition that the solar nebula started with represents one datapoint in terms of galactic chemical evolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solar composition can be measured excellently by observing the sun as well as by analyzing primitive meteorites. Except for volatile species, e.g., hydrogen and the noble gases, the composition of these two sample sets agree very well with each other. However, there are some anomalies that can be found in meteorites, which are very indicative of the exact circumstances under which the solar system formed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="short-lived-radionuclides">Short-lived radionuclides&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Some of the anomalies that can be found in primitive objects from the solar system are enhancement in certain isotopes due to the in situ radioactive decay of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs). Calcium aluminum-rich refractory inclusions (CAIs), which are fluffy looking phases in primitive meteorites, are some of the very first material that condensed in the solar nebula and are the ideal samples to look for such anomalies.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="determining-the-abundance-of-slrs-in-the-solar-nebula">Determining the abundance of SLRs in the solar nebula&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If for example the short-lived &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe was incorporated into a solid that condensed early on in the solar system we would be able to measure it today as an enhancement of &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Ni since the original &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe, which has a half-life of 2.6 Ma, would have all decayed to its stable daughter by now. The figure below shows how the presence of SLRs can be detected in a given sample.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://galactic-forensics.space/img/projects/slrs/fe60_isochron.png" alt="Schematic on Measuring an Isochron">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The figure on left shows the scenario at formation. Different minerals condense with different amounts of iron to nickel elemental compositions. The figure in the middle shows what happens with these different phases once they are solidified. The y-axis here always shows the &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Ni/&lt;sup>58&lt;/sup>Ni ratio. The more iron a phase condensed with the more &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe it will have incorporated as well. Thus, once all the &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe has decayed to &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Ni the phases will end up with different &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Ni/&lt;sup>58&lt;/sup>Ni ratios. The figure on the right shows the scenario today. By measuring different phases for their Fe/Ni elemental ratio (shwown on the x-axis) and their nickel isotopic composition (y-axis), the original value of the &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe/&lt;sup>56&lt;/sup>Fe at the time of condensation can be determined by fitting a line to these measurements. In above example this line will have the form:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$\frac{^{60}\rm{Ni}}{^{58}\rm{Ni}} = \left(\frac{^{60}\rm{Fe}}{^{56}\rm{Fe}}\right)_ 0 \times \frac{^{56}\rm{Fe}}{^{58}\rm{Ni}} + \left(\frac{^{60}\rm{Ni}}{^{58}\rm{Ni}}\right)_ 0$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, the isotope ratios with subscript 0 represent the initial composition of the isotope ratio when the phase condensed. The original &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe/&lt;sup>56&lt;/sup>Fe ratio is thus nothing else than the slope of the regression.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assuming that an SLR was distributed homogeneously in the early solar system allows to also date phases relative to each other. For example, if one phase shows half the initial &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe/&lt;sup>56&lt;/sup>Fe than another phase we can say that the phase with less initial &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe condensed one &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe half life (2.6 Ma) after the first one.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-presence-of-sup26supal-and-its-effects">The presence of &lt;sup>26&lt;/sup>Al and its effects&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of the most prominent SLRs that has been shown to be present in the solar nebula is &lt;sup>26&lt;/sup>Al (half life 717 ka). Many studies have shown that &lt;sup>26&lt;/sup>Al was distributed homogeneously in the solar nebula and that its initial abundance when CAIs formed was $$^{26}\rm{Al}/^{27}\rm{Al} = 5\times10^{-5}$$. This has important implications because it allows us to date different phases in the early solar system relative to each other. Furhtermore, when &lt;sup>26&lt;/sup>Al decays to &lt;sup>26&lt;/sup>Mg it releases 4 MeV of energy. This is a significant amount and has been shown to be able to heat an asteroid parent body of a given size (and thus of a given &lt;sup>26&lt;/sup>Al content) significally. In fact, &lt;sup>26&lt;/sup>Al has been invoked as being a crucial heat source that started the differentiation of early planetesimals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The presence of &lt;sup>26&lt;/sup>Al in the solar system raises the quesion on where it came from. Since its half-life is only 717 ka it had to be produced just prior to solar system formation. The key to decipher where it came from comes from studying other SLRs that were also present in the solar nebula.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-curious-case-of-sup60supfe-in-the-solar-nebula">The curious case of &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe in the solar nebula&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One nuclide that can help us solve the question on where the &lt;sup>26&lt;/sup>Al in the early solar system came from is &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe. If &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe is also present in the solar nebula it was likely produced and injected along with &lt;sup>26&lt;/sup>Al. A large amount of &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe in the early solar nebula, by which we mean a value of $$^{60}\rm{Fe}/^{56}\rm{Fe} &amp;gt; 5\times10^{-7}$$ would make it likely that a supernova that exploded just before the solar system produced and injected the two nucldies. A low value of $$^{60}\rm{Fe}/^{56}\rm{Fe} \sim 10^{-8}$$ would however indicate that no such supernova took place and that the &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe does not need to be produced but is rather the galactic background value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This discussion might seem very fabricated, however, for years and years the community has argued over the amount of &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe present in the solar nebula and the mentioned values are not just randomly picked. In situ studies of chondrules, objects that formed in the solar system about 2 Ma after CAIs, by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) showed high &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe values and thus pointed towards a supernova source. Bulk studies of many meteorites on the other hand consistently measured low &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe values. Until recently, the in situ measurements could not be tested with other techniques than SIMS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/aabba9" target="_blank">recent publication&lt;/a> we re-analyzed one chondrule with
&lt;a href="https://galactic-forensics.space/project/rims">resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS)&lt;/a>. This sample has previously only been studied with SIMS. RIMS has the advantage over SIMS that all nickel isotopes can be measured without interferences. SIMS however can only anlyze &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Ni, &lt;sup>61&lt;/sup>Ni, and &lt;sup>62&lt;/sup>Ni. In order to determine the excess in &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Ni the measurements needs to be normalized to another isotope (see isochron figure above). Furthermore, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope_fractionation" target="_blank">mass dependent fractionation&lt;/a> also has to be corrected for, thus measuring a third isotope is required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://galactic-forensics.space/img/projects/slrs/ni_isos_dap1.png" alt="Nickel isotopes in DAP1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above figure shows the new results obtained by RIMS (left, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/aabba9" target="_blank">Trappitsch et al., 2018&lt;/a>) versus a re-evaluation of the old results by SIMS (right, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2017.06.013" target="_blank">Telus et al., 2018&lt;/a>). To evaluate the SIMS measurements requires doing the described corrections with the low abundance isotope &lt;sup>61&lt;/sup>Ni. This results in extreme correlations of the uncertainties, which, if not adequately accounted for, can seem like excesses in &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Ni due to in situ decay of &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe. With RIMS however this problem does not exist. The figure on the left clearly shows that the errors are uncorrelated thanks to the ability to measure &lt;sup>58&lt;/sup>Ni.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our recent re-evaluation has brought up issues with the data processing that has been done in the determination of the initial &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe abundance. It remains to be seen if this is the case for all samples, however, preliminary evaluations of other SIMS measurements show that the same problem occurs in the rest of the dataset. A supernova thus cannot have injected the &lt;sup>26&lt;/sup>Al and another source, e.g., &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aa992e" target="_blank">a Wolf-Rayet star&lt;/a>, is required to explain its high value in the solar nebula.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resonance Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title><link>https://galactic-forensics.space/project/rims/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 15:34:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://galactic-forensics.space/project/rims/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-measurement-challenge">The measurement challenge&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Most of the large stardust grains are still only a few micrometers in size. Determining the trace element isotopic composition thus requries a very sensitive technique. In addition, the ideal technique should be able to determine between different isobars, i.e., be able to analyze isotopes of different elements that have the same mass, e.g., &lt;sup>58&lt;/sup>Fe and &lt;sup>58&lt;/sup>Ni, simultaneously.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="resonance-ionization-mass-spectrometry">Resonance ionization mass spectrometry&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS) is an ideal technique to analyze such particles. The following animation shows schematics on how RIMS works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://galactic-forensics.space/img/projects/rims/rims_animation.gif" alt="RIMS Animation">&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Overview of a RIMS instrument. On the left is the target / sample that should be analyzed. Then ion optics will guide the ions in the time-of-flight mass spectrometer. In this part, ions are initially given the same energy and are then separated by mass over charge by the total flight time they take from the extractor to the detector. The blue box represents the resonance ionization lasers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Material from a sample (target) is removed by either using an ion beam or a desorption laser.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After removing sample material a mixture of mostly neutral atoms and secondary ions (usually less than 1%) will be present above the samples.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since the secondary ions are generally noise in RIMS, they are ejected from the sampling area by applying a high voltage to the extraction optics. These secondary ions are given so much energy that they will fly into the back of the reflector and be neturalized there. They thus cannot reach the detector.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Above the sample a cloud of neutral atoms is left behind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Resonance lasers ionize all isotopes of the elements of interest selectively creating photoions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By applying the correct voltages to the instrument the created photoions are extracted into the mass spectrometers and analyzed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="resonance-ionization-with-tisapphire-lasers">Resonance ionization with Ti:Sapphire lasers&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The advantage of RIMS is the ionization of neutral atoms by tunable, resonant lasers. First of all this process is highly effective since almost all of the atoms that come off in the removal event are neutrals. Further, resonance ionization means that multiple lasers are tuned to stepwise and resonantly excite an atom until it is singly ionized. The figure below for example shows an example for the ionization of titanium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://galactic-forensics.space/img/projects/rims/ti_ionization_scheme.png" alt="Ti Ionization Scheme">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This ionization scheme is taken from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/C8JA00269J" target="_blank">Trappitsch et al. (2018)&lt;/a>. Shown are mutliple transitions for titanium, all of which are highly selective and effective for only this specific element, here titanium. Thus, other elements with potentially overlapping isobars are not ionized.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mass-spectra">Mass spectra&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The figure below shows a mass spectrum recorded by RIMS for the quasi-simultaneous analysis of iron and nickel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://galactic-forensics.space/img/projects/rims/feni_ms_sep.png" alt="RIMS Mass Spectrum for Iron and Nickel">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While iron and nickel have an overlapping isobar at mass 58, the ionization of nickel was delayed by several hundred nanoseconds with respect to the ionization of nickel. In the time-of-flight mass analyzer this separation resulted in a separation of these two identical masses allowing the simultaneous detection of &lt;sup>58&lt;/sup>Fe and &lt;sup>58&lt;/sup>Ni. RIMS thus, compared to other techniques, allows us to analyze elements with inherent isobaric overlaps simultaneously for all isotopes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="instruments">Instruments&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Currently only two RIMS instruments are being used for cosmochemistry worldwide, both of which I have worked on. These instruments are the &lt;a href="https://geosci.uchicago.edu/research/planetary-sciences-and-cosmochemistry/" target="_blank">CHILI (Chicago Instrument for Laser Ionization) instrument at the University of Chicago&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://str.llnl.gov/january-2017/isselhardt" target="_blank">Livermore LION (Laser Ionization of Neutrals) instrument at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The image above shows the LION instrument. The mass spectrometer can be seen on the right side, however, the reflectron (in this setup the top of the instrument) is outside the field of view. The center and left part shows the six tunable Ti:Sapphire lasers which allow the simultaneous ionization of various different elements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cosmic ray exposure ages</title><link>https://galactic-forensics.space/project/cosnucs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 15:34:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://galactic-forensics.space/project/cosnucs/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="irradiation-of-bodies-in-space">Irradiation of bodies in space&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Objects in space are constantly irradiated with high-energy particles. Two sources of such particles exist in the solar system: solar cosmic rays (SCRs) originating from the sun and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://galactic-forensics.space/img/projects/cosnucs/scr_gcr.png" alt="SCR and GCR Spectrum">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Above figure shows a comparison of the SCR (blue, solid line) and GCR (green, dashed line) spectrum. The SCR can only penetrate the upper few centimeters of any given material in space due to its low energies. On the other hand, GCRs can penetrate down to several meters below the surface of a given meteoroid. Since the outer layers of meteorites are generally lost, only the GCR flux matters when analyzing meteorites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note&lt;/em>: Scientists working on cosmogenic nuclides generally distinguish between meteoroids and meteorites. A meteoroid is an rock in space that broke off from its parent asteroid, is thus irradiated by SCR and GCR, and has not hit the Earth yet. A meteorite on the other hand is the rock that fell from the sky, i.e., the meteoroid after it fell down to earth, thus passed the atmosphere and lost most of its outer material by ablation. This ablation usually leads to a meteoroid loosing its SCR record such that only GCR effects can be measured in meteorites.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="spallation-reactions">Spallation reactions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The irradiation of material in space with high-energy particles induced the production of spallogenic nuclides. The figure below shows a schematic on how spallogenic reactions take place on the example of a &lt;sup>28&lt;/sup>Si nucleus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://galactic-forensics.space/img/projects/cosnucs/spallation_schematic.png" alt="Spallation Schematic">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In panel (1), a high energy proton strikes a target nucleus (here &lt;sup>28&lt;/sup>Si). This nucleus then breaks up
into various lighter nuclei (2). The excited nucleus left behind then decays, e.g., via γ or
neutron emission and a cosmogenic nuclide (here &lt;sup>21&lt;/sup>Ne) is left behind (3).
For a given high-energy particle &lt;em>k&lt;/em> (a proton for the example above) at a given energy &lt;em>E&lt;/em>, the production of a cosmogenic nuclide &lt;em>j&lt;/em> from a target element &lt;em>i&lt;/em> can be calculated as:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$P_{j,i,k} = \sigma_{j,i,k} J_k$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, &lt;em>J&lt;sub>k&lt;/sub>&lt;/em> describes the flux of the incident particle of a given energy. In a real scenario many target elements are present in a given meteoroid that can contribute to the production of nuclide &lt;em>j&lt;/em>. Furthermore, the GCR and SCR have a variety of different energies, see for example the figure showing the SCR and GCR spectrum above. The total production rate &lt;em>P&lt;sub>j&lt;/sub>&lt;/em> of nuclide &lt;em>j&lt;/em> in a meteoroid can then be calculated as:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$P_j = \sum_{i} c_i \frac{N_A}{A_i} \sum_k \int_0^{\infty} \sigma_{i,j,k} J_k(E)dE$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first sum over &lt;em>i&lt;/em> considers the meteoroid&amp;rsquo;s composition. Here &lt;em>c&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub>&lt;/em> is the concentration of target nuclide &lt;em>i&lt;/em>, &lt;em>N&lt;sub>A&lt;/sub>&lt;/em> Avogadro&amp;rsquo;s constant, and &lt;em>A&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub>&lt;/em> the mean mass of nuclide &lt;em>i&lt;/em>. The production rate also depends on different target elements &lt;em>k&lt;/em>, to calculate the total production rate from all all projectiles we thus need to sum over &lt;em>k&lt;/em>. The nuclear cross sections are of course projectile &lt;em>k&lt;/em>, target nucleus &lt;em>i&lt;/em>, product &lt;em>j&lt;/em>, and energy &lt;em>E&lt;/em> dependent, while the flux of the high-energy particles depends on their energy &lt;em>E&lt;/em>. Integrating over all energies is thus required as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cosmic-ray-exposure-ages">Cosmic ray exposure ages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The irradiation of a meteorite space induces spallation reactions and leads to the production of so called cosmogenic nuclides. Cosmogenic nuclide production is generally a very minor contribution and thus can only be detected in low-abundance isotopes, e.g., noble gases. If for example the &lt;sup>21&lt;/sup>Ne composition in a given meteorite can be measured (&lt;em>m&lt;/em>) and the production rate &lt;em>P&lt;sub>j&lt;/sub>&lt;/em> can be calculated, the time the object was irradiated in space can be determined as:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$t = \frac{m}{P_j}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The time &lt;em>t&lt;/em> is generally referred to as the cosmic ray exposure age of the sample. This technique has for example been used in order to determine the age of stardust grains in a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1904573117" target="_blank">recent study&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Code Development</title><link>https://galactic-forensics.space/project/code/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 15:34:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://galactic-forensics.space/project/code/</guid><description>&lt;p>Research is fun when it consists of new and unique tasks. For repetitive ones on the other hand, computers are uniquely suited. Furthermore, in order to run
&lt;a href="https://galactic-forensics.space/project/rims/">RIMS instruments&lt;/a> control software is required. We have worked and are currently engaged in multiple code development projects. You can find many of these projects on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/galactic-forensics" target="_blank">lab&amp;rsquo;s GitHub page&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/trappitsch" target="_blank">Reto&amp;rsquo;s GitHub page&lt;/a>, or the &lt;a href="https://github.com/RIMS-Code" target="_blank">RIMS-Code GitHub page&lt;/a>. Below we outline some notable projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note&lt;/em>: We are strong supporters of free and open source software (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">FOSS&lt;/a>). Scientific research is generally paid for by the taxpayer. The outcome should thus be freely available for everyone. We strive to publish all software under open source licenses and only use open source software in our daily life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank">&lt;img src="https://galactic-forensics.space/img/projects/code/python_logo.png" alt="Python Logo">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you will notice, a dominating programming language in our lab is Python. This becomes especially clear when you look at the GitHub pages given above. If you are interested in any of our specific code or you have questions, please feel free to
&lt;a href="https://galactic-forensics.space/contact/">contact us&lt;/a>! Also, contributions to our codes are always welcomed. Please have a look at the developer guides (when available). Feel free to create pull requests for documentation enhancement, small bug fixes, etc. We are looking forward to your ideas and issues.&lt;/p>
