While He diffusion is considerably slower in SiC than in many silicate phases, He retentivity may be limited under some conditions. For example, helium will be lost from SiC grains over much shorter timescales than potential survival times of SiC presolar grains in the solar nebula. When exposed to impact heating followed by slow cooling, nearly complete loss of He from SiC grains near the site of impact will occur within several hours to a few days. For SiC grains at greater distance from impact sites, He would be better retained, depending on the rapidity of cooling. At tens of km away from a large impactor, where peak T would be ∼800 K, SiC grains would lose about 50% of their He if the grains cooled within a few thousand years, and 5% if they cooled within a few tens of years. At greater distances where heating is more modest (500 K and lower), SiC grains would be quite retentive of He even for cases of very slow cooling. Helium would also be retained in cases of impact heating followed by very rapid cooling. For these short heating pulses, 10 μm diameter SiC grains would retain more than 50% of their He for peak heating temperatures of 2173, 1973 and 1773 K for durations of 3, 10 and 60 s, respectively."><link rel=alternate hreflang=en-us href=https://galactic-forensics.space/publication/cherniak-16/><meta name=theme-color content="#003478"><script src=/js/mathjax-config.js></script><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/academicons/1.8.6/css/academicons.min.css integrity="sha256-uFVgMKfistnJAfoCUQigIl+JfUaP47GrRKjf6CTPVmw=" crossorigin=anonymous><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.12.0-1/css/all.min.css integrity="sha256-4w9DunooKSr3MFXHXWyFER38WmPdm361bQS/2KUWZbU=" crossorigin=anonymous><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fancybox/3.5.7/jquery.fancybox.min.css integrity="sha256-Vzbj7sDDS/woiFS3uNKo8eIuni59rjyNGtXfstRzStA=" crossorigin=anonymous><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.18.1/styles/github.min.css crossorigin=anonymous title=hl-light><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.18.1/styles/dracula.min.css crossorigin=anonymous title=hl-dark disabled><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/1.5.1/leaflet.css integrity="sha256-SHMGCYmST46SoyGgo4YR/9AlK1vf3ff84Aq9yK4hdqM=" crossorigin=anonymous><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lazysizes/5.1.2/lazysizes.min.js integrity="sha256-Md1qLToewPeKjfAHU1zyPwOutccPAm5tahnaw7Osw0A=" crossorigin=anonymous async></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml.js integrity crossorigin=anonymous async></script><link rel=stylesheet href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Itim%7CMerriweather%7Chttp://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Itim%7CMerriweather-Sans&display=swap"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/academic.css><link rel=manifest href=/index.webmanifest><link rel=icon type=image/png href=/images/icon_huf9971d92eb29bf4da5830b881252d169_24412_32x32_fill_lanczos_center_2.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon type=image/png href=/images/icon_huf9971d92eb29bf4da5830b881252d169_24412_192x192_fill_lanczos_center_2.png><link rel=canonical href=https://galactic-forensics.space/publication/cherniak-16/><meta property="twitter:card" content="summary"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Galactic Forensics Laboratory"><meta property="og:url" content="https://galactic-forensics.space/publication/cherniak-16/"><meta property="og:title" content="Diffusion of helium in SiC and implications for retention of cosmogenic He | Galactic Forensics Laboratory"><meta property="og:description" content="Diffusion of helium has been characterized in silicon carbide of cubic and hexagonal (4H and 6H) forms.
