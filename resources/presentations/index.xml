However, some of these rocks simply contain the original, unaltered composition of the solar nebula and therefore allow us to study the material from which the sun, planets, and ultimately life itself formed. Detailed analyses of the isotopic composition of meteorites revealed various nucleosynthetic anomalies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this talk I present recent discoveries on the overall nucleosynthetic anomalies in the Solar System that point towards various nucleosynthetic sources. In detail anomalies due to short-lived radionuclides that were present in the solar nebula and have since decayed are discussed. The talk focuses on how we can detect and measure them and what they can teach us about the make-up of the molecular cloud from which the Solar System formed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Presolar Grains</title><link>https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/presentations/2023-03-13_russbach_presolar_grains/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/presentations/2023-03-13_russbach_presolar_grains/</guid><description>&lt;p>Presolar grains are bona-fide stardust particles that condensed in the death throes of stars and were incorporated into the solar nebula 4.5 Ga ago. Some of these samples survived unaltered until today and can be found in and extracted from primitve meteorites. These grains recorded the nucleosynthetic fingerprint of their parent stars and are analyzed to elucidate stellar nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this talk I introduce how we process these grains in the lab to gain insight into astrophysical problems. Measurement techniques, limitations, as well as overview of scientific insights that were possible from isotope measurements of presolar grains are discussed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resonance Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title><link>https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/presentations/2023-01-17-sims-winterschool/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/presentations/2023-01-17-sims-winterschool/</guid><description>&lt;p>These slides are for a lecture on RIMS given at the 2023 SIMS Winterschool
at the University of Lausanne. It includes an introduction to RIMS,
goes into the nitty-gritty of the technique, discusses several applications,
tricks that can be used in RIMS, and finally discloses some limitations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hands-on Astrophysics</title><link>https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/presentations/2022-03-10-prl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/presentations/2022-03-10-prl/</guid><description>&lt;p>This talk, given at the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, India, presents an introduction to analyzing presolar stardust grains by resonance ionization mass spectrometry. It also introduces the basics of stellar evolution of low-mass stars and its implication on the slow neutron-capture process nuclei. The interplay between stardust analysis and s-process nucleosynthesis models is discussed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resonance Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title><link>https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/presentations/2022-02-28-epfl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/presentations/2022-02-28-epfl/</guid><description>&lt;p>This talk is geared heavily towards mass spectrometrists that are interested
in resonance ionization mass spectrometry and want to know more on how
it works. The science is kept to a minimum and the talk mainly focuses on
the technical aspects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Curious Case of $^{60}$Fe in the Early Solar System</title><link>https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/presentations/2021-09-22-nic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/presentations/2021-09-22-nic/</guid><description>&lt;p>This invited talk reviews the discrepancies between in situ and bulk measurements
of the initial &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe abundance in the early Solar System. The
abundance of this short-lived radionuclide is important to constrain precisely
since it informs the source that contributed the &lt;sup>26&lt;/sup>Al that was present
in the solar nebula. The presentation discusses the new re-evaluation of the
in-situ secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements and discusses
the implications of this re-evaluation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The talk was presented at the 16&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> Symposium on Nuclei in the Cosmos.

and how it can be used to better understand astrophysical processes such as
the slow neutron capture process and the formation of proton- and neutron-rich
nuclides. Finally, the presentation discusses future opportunities with stardust
and how these measurements could help to further our knowledge of
galactic chemical evolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The talk was presented at the virtual 2020 JINA Horizons Meeting.
