It also introduces the basics of stellar evolution of low-mass stars and its implication on the slow neutron-capture process nuclei. The interplay between stardust analysis and s-process nucleosynthesis models is discussed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resonance Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title><link>https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/presentations/2022-02-28-epfl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/presentations/2022-02-28-epfl/</guid><description>&lt;p>This talk is geared heavily towards mass spectrometrists that are interested
in resonance ionization mass spectrometry and want to know more on how
it works. The science is kept to a minimum and the talk mainly focuses on
the technical aspects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Curious Case of $^{60}$Fe in the Early Solar System</title><link>https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/presentations/2021-09-22-nic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://galactic-forensics.space/resources/presentations/2021-09-22-nic/</guid><description>&lt;p>This invited talk reviews the discrepancies between in situ and bulk measurements
of the initial &lt;sup>60&lt;/sup>Fe abundance in the early Solar System. The
abundance of this short-lived radionuclide is important to constrain precisely
since it informs the source that contributed the &lt;sup>26&lt;/sup>Al that was present
in the solar nebula. The presentation discusses the new re-evaluation of the
in-situ secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements and discusses
the implications of this re-evaluation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The talk was presented at the 16&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> Symposium on Nuclei in the Cosmos.

and how it can be used to better understand astrophysical processes such as
the slow neutron capture process and the formation of proton- and neutron-rich
nuclides. Finally, the presentation discusses future opportunities with stardust
and how these measurements could help to further our knowledge of
galactic chemical evolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The talk was presented at the virtual 2020 JINA Horizons Meeting.
